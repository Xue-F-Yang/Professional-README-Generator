# README Generator

  ## Description
  The code is a Node.js application that prompts the user with a series of questions to gather information about their project, such as the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, GitHub username, email address, license, and guidelines for contributing. The user's responses are then used to generate a README file using the generateMarkdown function from the generateMarkdown.js file. The writeFile function is used to write the generated README file to the ./dist/generated-README.md file path. The init function prompts the user with the questions and stores their responses. The init function is called to initialize the application, and the user's responses are passed to the generateMarkdown function to generate the README file. Finally, the writeFile function is called to write the generated README file to the file path.
